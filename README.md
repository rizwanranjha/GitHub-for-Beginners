| **Remote**            | Online Repo                        | A Git repo hosted on GitHub or elsewhere, usually named `origin`.                                       |
| **Upstream**          | Source Repo                        | Often refers to the original repo when you forked a project and want to sync your fork.                 |

| **.gitignore**        | Ignore Rules                       | A file specifying what files/folders Git should ignore (not track).                                     |
| **Rebase**            | Replay Commits                     | Re-applies commits on top of another base commit. Cleaner history but riskier than merge.               |

### 🎯 Tips for Admins & Beginners

* **"Push"** ≠ Save. Git requires you to `commit` first, then `push`.
* **"Pull"** does both `fetch` and `merge` – so if you only want to *see* changes without applying them, use `fetch`.
* **“Get Latest Version”** is often a *pull* in Git terms (especially in GUI tools).
* GitHub Desktop simplifies these concepts under “Publish branch”, “Push origin”, “Fetch origin”, etc. – always check what action it’s performing under the hood.

## General Git & GitHub Questions ❓ + Common Terms

### 📁 Repositories & Forking

**What is a GitHub repository (repo)?**

> A project space that contains your codebase, version history, issues, pull requests, and collaboration tools.

**What’s the difference between fork and clone?**

* **Fork**: Creates a copy under your GitHub account (used to contribute to other projects).
* **Clone**: Downloads a copy to your local machine for development.

**What does Code Checkout mean?**

> It refers to checking out (switching to) a specific branch or commit in a repo.

---

### 🔄 Version Control Basics

**What is a commit in Git? (aka Code Commit or Code Check-in)**

> A saved snapshot of code changes. Often called check-in in corporate tools like TFS/Azure DevOps.

**What is the difference between commit, push, and check-in?**

| Term   | Git Meaning            | Also Known As    |
| ------ | ---------------------- | ---------------- |

| Push   | Upload to GitHub       | Code push        |
| Pull   | Get latest from remote | Get Latest, Sync |
| Fetch  | Get changes (no apply) | Update status    |

**What is a `.gitignore` file?**

> A file that tells Git which files/folders to skip (e.g., `node_modules/`, `.env`, etc.)

**What is a merge? What is a rebase?**

* **Merge**: Combines two branches' histories and content.
* **Rebase**: Moves commits onto a new base, resulting in a linear history.

**What is HEAD in Git?**

> It points to your current commit/branch location — think of it as "you are here."

---

### 🤝 Collaboration & Contributions

**What is a Pull Request (PR)?**

> A formal request to merge your code changes into another branch or repo (usually `main` or `dev`).

**What is a contribution on GitHub?**

> Any visible action tracked by GitHub: commits, pull requests, issue comments, wiki edits, etc.

**What is a collaborator vs contributor?**

* **Collaborator**: Added by repo admin with write access.
* **Contributor**: Anyone who contributed via PR, issue, etc.

**What is meant by “Get Latest” or “Sync Repo”?**

> These usually refer to pulling the latest commits from the remote repo.

**What is a conflict in Git?**

> Happens when Git can’t auto-merge code and asks the user to manually choose which version to keep.

---

### 🔐 Admin & Security Concepts

**Why is 2FA important on GitHub?**

> It adds an extra layer of security to prevent unauthorized access.

**What is a Branch Protection Rule?**

> Settings that prevent force pushes, require PR reviews, or enforce CI before merging into important branches.

**What is Dependabot?**

> GitHub’s tool that scans for security vulnerabilities in dependencies and suggests automatic updates.

---

### 🛠️ DevOps & Automation

**What is GitHub Actions?**

> A CI/CD tool built into GitHub that lets you automate workflows for build, test, and deployment.

**What is a `.yml` or `.yaml` file in GitHub Actions?**

> A configuration file that defines when and how your workflows should run (e.g., on every push).

**What’s the difference between GitHub-hosted and self-hosted runners?**

* **GitHub-hosted**: Free machines provided by GitHub.
* **Self-hosted**: Your own machine executes workflow jobs.

**What is Continuous Integration (CI)? What is Continuous Deployment (CD)?**

* **CI**: Automatically testing and integrating code on every push or PR.
* **CD**: Automatically releasing changes to production after CI succeeds.
