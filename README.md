## 🧠 Common Git Terminology & Synonyms Glossary

| Term                  | Also Called                        | Description                                                                                             |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Commit**            | Save, Snapshot                     | Records changes to files in your local Git repo. Doesn’t send to GitHub yet.                            |
| **Push**              | Upload, Sync                       | Sends your local commits to the remote repository (e.g., GitHub).                                       |
| **Pull**              | Get Latest, Download Changes, Sync | Retrieves the latest changes from the remote repo and merges into your current branch.                  |
| **Fetch**             | Check for Changes                  | Gets the latest changes from remote without merging. Useful for seeing what’s new before merging.       |
| **Merge**             | Combine                            | Integrates changes from one branch into another (e.g., from `dev` to `main`).                           |
| **Branch**            | Feature Branch, Dev Copy           | A separate line of development. Allows isolated work without affecting `main`.                          |
| **Checkout**          | Switch                             | Moves you to a different branch or commit.                                                              |
| **Clone**             | Download Repo                      | Creates a local copy of a remote GitHub repo.                                                           |
| **Fork**              | Copy Repo                          | Creates a personal copy of someone else’s GitHub repo (under your account). Used for contributing.      |
| **Pull Request (PR)** | Merge Request, Code Review         | Proposes changes from one branch (usually a fork) to another branch in the main repo.                   |
| **Stash**             | Save Work Temporarily              | Temporarily saves uncommitted changes without committing them.                                          |
| **Revert**            | Undo Commit                        | Creates a new commit that undoes the changes of a previous commit.                                      |
| **Reset**             | Discard Changes                    | Moves HEAD and optionally discards commits or staged changes. Use with care.                            |
| **HEAD**              | Current Snapshot                   | Represents the latest commit on the current branch. Think of it as "where you are" in the repo history. |
| **Origin**            | Remote                             | The default name for the remote GitHub repository.                                                      |
| **Remote**            | Online Repo                        | A Git repo hosted on GitHub or elsewhere, usually named `origin`.                                       |
| **Upstream**          | Source Repo                        | Often refers to the original repo when you forked a project and want to sync your fork.                 |
| **Conflict**          | Merge Clash                        | Happens when Git can’t auto-merge changes between branches. Must be resolved manually.                  |
| **Diff**              | Changes, Difference                | Shows what changed between commits, branches, or files.                                                 |
| **.gitignore**        | Ignore Rules                       | A file specifying what files/folders Git should ignore (not track).                                     |
| **Rebase**            | Replay Commits                     | Re-applies commits on top of another base commit. Cleaner history but riskier than merge.               |

### 🎯 Tips for Admins & Beginners

* **"Push"** ≠ Save. Git requires you to `commit` first, then `push`.
* **"Pull"** does both `fetch` and `merge` – so if you only want to *see* changes without applying them, use `fetch`.
* **“Get Latest Version”** is often a *pull* in Git terms (especially in GUI tools).
* GitHub Desktop simplifies these concepts under “Publish branch”, “Push origin”, “Fetch origin”, etc. – always check what action it’s performing under the hood.
